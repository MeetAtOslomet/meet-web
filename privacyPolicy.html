        cases, data which, on its own, cannot be linked to an individual person,
        may constitute personal data if it is used in combination with other
        data.

        about you. You also have the right to supplement any and all incomplete

      <p>
        In certain circumstances, you have the right to demand limited
        processing of your personal data. Limiting the processing of personal
        data means that your personal data will still be registered, but the
        opportunities for further processing are limited. If you believe that

        will be limited until, if relevant, we have rectified your personal
        data, or until we have been able to assess whether your complaint is
        justified. In other circumstances you may also demand a more permanent
        limitation on the processing of your personal data. In order to qualify
        for the right to limit processing of personal data, the conditions

        that you also specify which personal data you want erased. We will then

        exceptions to your right to erasure. For example, we may need to store
        personal data for the purpose of performing a task in compliance of the

        secret address, etc. The right to object is not unconditional, and it is
        contingent upon the legal basis for the processing, and on your
        particular circumstances. The conditions are established by Article 21
        of the GDPR. If you object to processing of your personal data, we will
        consider whether the conditions for filing an objection have been met.
        If we find that you have the right to object to the processing and that
        your objection is justified, we will discontinue processing, and you
        will have the right to demand erasure of the data. Please be advised
        that we, under certain circumstances, may make exceptions from erasure,
        e.g. if we have to store your personal data for the purpose of
        performing a task in compliance with the Act Relating to Universities
        and University Colleges, or for reasons of public interest.

        unlawfully, or if you believe we failed to protect your rights, you have
        the right to file a complaint against processing. Please see item 10
